represent-silex
===============

This is the represent.la startup map ported to [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) for modularity and ease of maintenance.

Installation: 

Create a new folder, and clone from github. Then use composer to get the Silex micro-framework and components:

    git clone git://github.com/travisjryan/represent-silex.git .
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install


Rename config.php.dist to config.php and update with appropriate configuration parameters
